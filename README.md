# Google Books UI

A page that allows users to search for books using various keywords, for example author or title.

The page contains a input and a search button. When the search button is clicked, books are requested from the Google books API using the input value as a query string. The books then get rendered to the page.

## Topics Learned
- API
- async/await functions

## Todos
- Add a modal that contains additional information about the book, for example published date and number of pages; modal should open when you click on a specific book
- Add user feedback when new search result gets rendered to the page
